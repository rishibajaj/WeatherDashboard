# Weather-Dashboard

A weather dashboard displaying the 5 day forecast for multiple cities of the user's choice

## Description

This application uses the geocoding and 5 day weather forecast apis from OpenWeather to provide a five day weather forecast for the city of the user's choice. The app uses local storage to store the last five cities searched for so the user can easily revisit the forecast when they reopen or refresh the page.

The deployed application can be found at:

<https://rishibajaj.github.io/WeatherDashboard/>

## Usage

Type the name of a city into the search box and click the Search button or press enter. The weather forecast for that city will be displayed for the current day plus the next five days.

A button will also be rendered to the page for that city so the user can easily access the information again on restarting or refreshing the page. Buttons can be rendered for the last five cities searched for.

Here is a screenshot of the deployed application:
